My name is Jack Tarricone. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computational Mountain Studies Lab](https://www.computationalmountainstudies.com/), in the [Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences](https://www.unr.edu/hydrologic-sciences), at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focuses on optimizing and utilizing remote sensing techniques to estimate snowpack and surface water properties and fluxes at various space and time scales. I'm currently funded by the [NASA SnowEx](https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex) campaign, a nationwide effort to advance our understanding of snow remote sensing. I received my B.A. *magna cum laude* in Geography from the University of Colorado, Boulder.
